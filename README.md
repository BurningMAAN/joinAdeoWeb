## Startup
in order to launch this microservice you need to create a database, on your terminal, run 
<b>php artisan db:seed --class=ProductsTableSeeder</b> 
to generate data by using <a href="https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker">Faker</a> library. 

Once it's done, on your terminal, run <b>php artisan serve</b> to launch the server.


P.S. Sorry that I am commiting all the work in one commit, but I was hurrying to do the task because this week was extra busy :(

GLHF!
